# Hi!👋

This is my portfolio, where you can find something about me and my projects.

<b>My website is a project itself.</b> I approached it as an opportunity to learn basics of <i>TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion</i>.

Being a junior developer, I sought help from various tutorials. I discovered a cool navigation header that tracks the section you're scrolling to. For a CV-style website, the <i>React Vertical Timeline Component</i> is excellent. You can explore it through link below.

As always, I used [Procreate](https://procreate.com/) app to draw my pixel art portrait and favicon.

## 💡 TIPS & TRICKS

Learn something everyday. Here are some nice shortcuts for my fellow juniors:

- <b>rfc</b> 👉 Write this in your blank file, hit Enter, and create the basic structure for a new React component.
- <b>ctrl + space bar</b> 👉 Use this to import faster; just click on the underlined component or element and choose from the suggestions.
